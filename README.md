1️⃣ Project Title: AI-Powered Bug Tracking System

2️⃣ Project Description
This project is an intelligent AI-Powered Bug Tracking System designed to help development teams automatically manage, classify, prioritize, and assign software issues. Users can create bug reports, detect duplicates, get severity predictions, and view real-time dashboards to speed up triage and resolution. Built with NLP and ML, it reduces manual overhead and improves team productivity.

It is built with Python, simple ML models, and a Streamlit/Flask interface for quick demos, providing clear dashboards and automated suggestions for easy issue handling.

Key Features ✅ Automatically classify bug reports by severity and type ✅ Smart prioritization and suggested assignees ✅ Duplicate detection to reduce redundant reports ✅ Real-time dashboards and metrics 📊 ✅ Integrations with GitHub Issues / CI pipelines 🔗

3️⃣ Tech Stack Used
📌 Programming Language: Python 🐍
📌 Libraries: scikit-learn / spaCy / Transformers (optional), Pandas, NumPy, Flask or Streamlit
📌 Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly / Streamlit components
📌 Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL / JSON or CSV for demo data
📌 Deployment (Optional): Docker, Heroku, or cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)

4️⃣ Installation Guide 🚀
🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Vishal1470/ai-powered-bug-tracking-system.git
cd ai-powered-bug-tracking-system

🔹 Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Step 3: Run the Project
If using Streamlit (demo UI): streamlit run app.py
If using Flask API: python app.py

5️⃣ How It Works? 🛠️
1️⃣ User submits bug reports with title, description, environment, and optional labels.
2️⃣ The system preprocesses text and uses NLP models to classify severity, component, and probable root cause.
3️⃣ Duplicate detection finds similar/open issues to prevent redundancy.
4️⃣ A prioritization model scores bugs by impact and urgency and suggests likely assignees.
5️⃣ Dashboards show trends, open vs resolved issues, and team KPIs; reports can be exported.

6️⃣ Example Output ✅
✅ New Bug: “App crashes on login” — Classified as High severity under Authentication
✅ Duplicate Detection: Found 2 similar open issues; suggested merge.
✅ Suggested Assignee: dev_backend_raj based on past fixes.
✅ View: Open Issues 12 | High Priority 3 | Avg. Resolution Time 2.4 days
✅ Export: weekly_bug_report.csv generated for analysis.

7️⃣ Future Improvements 🚀
🔹 Use advanced transformer models for better classification and triage
🔹 Add bi-directional sync with GitHub Issues and Jira for seamless workflow
🔹 Add role-based authentication and multi-team support
🔹 Build a notification system (Slack/MS Teams) for urgent bugs
🔹 Add anomaly detection to find unusual error spikes automatically
